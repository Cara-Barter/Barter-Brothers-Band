      <p>Two musical brothers born in a valley town on the borderlands of the Boundary, transplanted to the wild west coast on Vancouver Island.</p>

      <p>Having played separately in various bands and as solo performers the brothers came together to forge new sounds as a duo.
      Angus  Barter and Jamie Barter are both multi instrumentalists and individual songwriters who have self produced two albums.</p>

      <p>A tangle of roots rock with rich veins of singer songwriter, folk, blues and pop. Sibling harmonies are laced throughout the songs and fraternal bonds are obvious in the musical interplay that each adds to the other.</p>

      <p>Influences like <em>Indigo Girls, Blue Rodeo, Rodney Crowell, Leonard Cohen</em> and <em>Joan Armatrading</em> show in the strong poetic lyrical content.<p/>

      <p>With a diverse mix of melodic pop, rhythmic groove, yearning strumming and earnest emotion, <strong>Barter Bothers</strong> create music that is celebratory and introspective, familiar and new, mysterious and open, made for these times and ageless.</p>
